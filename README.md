# picoVM

A toy virtual machine.

This project includes a Compiler class which turns a simple form of assembly into bytecode.

The Agent class includes the bytecode interpreter that constitutes the virtual machine.

At this stage, global variables and I/O interrupts are not implemented.

A small set of unit tests are included in the picovm.Tests directory
